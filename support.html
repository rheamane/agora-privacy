        <p>Welcome to the Agora support page. We're here to help you have a smooth and thoughtful experience with the
            app.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

        <h3>ðŸ§  What is Agora?</h3>
        <p>Agora is a reflective space where you can express your thoughts and dilemmas to an AI model that runs
            entirely on
            your device. It's designed to offer philosophical and emotional support without collecting or storing
            personal data.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ”’ Is my data private?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Agora does not collect or store your conversations. Everything runs locally on your device, and no data
            is uploaded or shared externally.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ“¶ Do I need an internet connection to use Agora?</h3>
        <p>No. Agora runs fully offline, and all interactions with the AI happen directly on your device.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ‘¤ Do I need to sign up or create an account?</h3>
        <p>No account is needed to use Agora. The app is anonymous by design.</p>
